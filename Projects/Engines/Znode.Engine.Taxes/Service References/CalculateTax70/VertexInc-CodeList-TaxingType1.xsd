These territories are the Island of Heligoland and the territory of BÃ¼singen  (Germany); Ceuta, Melilla, and Canary Island (Spain); Livigno, Campione d'Italia, and the Italian waters of Lake Lugano (Italy); the French Overseas Departments of Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinque and  and Reunion, and Monaco (France); Mount Athos, also known asa Agion Poros (Greece).</xsd:documentation>
